# BonjourSDK

Bonjour made easy.

*Note:* This is a in-progress framework aimed to wrap Bonjour for OS X and iOS developers. Windows will be supported in near future.

## Sample Projects:
I'm working on a [OS X Receiver](https://github.com/void-main/Bonjour-OSX) and an [iOS Sender](https://github.com/void-main/Bonjour-iOS). Those repos are empty for now.
